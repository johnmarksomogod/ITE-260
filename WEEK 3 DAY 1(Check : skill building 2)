#1
num= int(input("enter your number:" ))
if num >= 0:
    print("POSITIVE")
else:
    print("NEGATIVE")

OUTPUT
>
enter your number: -4
negative
>
#2
name= input("student Name: ")
sub1= int(input("enter grade in English:"))
sub2= int(input("enter grade in Math:"))
sub3= int(input("enter grade in Science:"))
sub4= int(input("enter grade in Filipino:"))
sub5= int(input("enter grade in MAPEH:"))

sum=(sub1+sub2+sub3+sub4+sub5)/5

print("Average: ",sum)

if sum >= 85:
 print("student Name:",name,"Average:",sum, "With Highest Honors")
elif sum >= 80:
    print("student Name:",name,"Average:",sum,"With High Honors")
elif sum >= 75:
    print("student Name:",name,"Average:",sum,"passed")
else:
    print("student Name:",name,"Average:",sum,"failed")
ouput:
>
student Name: John Mark
>
enter grade in English:88
>
enter grade in Math:93
>
enter grade in Science:89
>
enter grade in Filipino:87
>
enter grade in MAPEH:93
Average:  90.0
student Name: John Mark Average:  90.0 With Highest Honors

#3
userName = input("enter your username: ")
passW = input("enter your password: ")

user= "John"
passwd = "12345"

if userName == user and passW == passwd:
    print("you are in!")
elif userName != user and passW != passwd:
    print("invalid login")
elif  userName != user :
    print("incorrect username")
elif passW != passwd :
    print("incorrect password")

output
>
enter your username: John
>
enter your password: 12345
